\section{Human Evaluation of Instructions}

To evaluate how natural are the generated pointing actions and instructions, we recruited 480 subjects from mechanical Turk using the same protocol described in our Data Collection procedure, and asked them to rank how natural they regarded the instruction on a scale of \textit{0 to 5}. 
% asked subject the following question: 

% ``on a scale of 0 to 5, how natural is the instruction?''

The examples were randomly sampled from the videos of the referential pointing trials that we showed to subjects for both the Baxter and Kuka robots. These examples were selected in a way that we obtained equal number of samples from each cone. The average rating for samples from the $\ang{45}$, $\ang{67.5}$ and $\ang{90}$ cone are $3.625, 3.521$
and $3.650$ respectively. For Kuka, the average rating for samples from the $\ang{45}$, $\ang{67.5}$ and $\ang{90}$ cone are $3.450, 3.375$, and $3.400$. Overall, the average for Baxter is $3.600$, and for Kuka is $3.408$. The differences both between Kuka and Baxter, and different cones are not statistically significant ($t \leq |1.07|, p > 0.1 $).
% Malihe: exact numbers are:
% $t \leq |1.07|, p \geq 0.88 $
