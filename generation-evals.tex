\section{Human Evaluation of Instructions}

To evaluate how natural are the generated pointing actions and instructions, we recruited 480 subjects from mechanical Turk using the same protocol and asked them to rank how natural is the instruction on a scale of 0 to 5. 
% asked subject the following question: 

% ``on a scale of 0 to 5, how natural is the instruction?''

The examples were randomly sampled from the referential cases that we showed to subjects for the Baxter and Kuka referential trials in a way that that we have equal number of samples from each cone. The average rating for samples from the $\ang{45}$, $\ang{67.5}$ and $\ang{90}$ cone are 3.625, 3.521
and 3.650 respectively. For Kuka, the average rating for samples from the $\ang{45}$, $\ang{67.5}$ and $\ang{90}$ cone are 3.450, 3.375 and 3.400. Overall the average for Baxter is 3.600 and for Kuka is 3.408. The differences both between Kuka and Baxter and different cones are not statistically significant ($t \leq |1.07|, p > 0.1 $).

% Malihe: exact numbers are:
% $t \leq |1.07|, p \geq 0.88 $
